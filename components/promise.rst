Promise
=======

Promise used for asynchronous HTTP requests.

This will eventually be removed/deprecated and replaced with the upcoming Promise PSR.

.. note::

    Contract for the ``Http\Promise\Promise`` is temporary until `PSR is released`_.
    Once it is out, we will use this PSR in the main client and deprecate the old contract.

.. _`PSR is released`: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/php-fig/wzQWpLvNSjs
